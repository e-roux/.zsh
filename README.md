# ZSH

## Startup

 There are five startup files that zsh will read commands from:

`$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv`
`$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
`$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
`$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
`$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout

 If ZDOTDIR is not set, then the value of HOME is used; this is the usual case. See http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html

## Shell builtin commands

The full list is available in the [zsh documentation](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html).


## Completion

See https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/blob/master/zsh-completions-howto.org

Completion widgets are defined by the -C option to the zle builtin command provided by the zsh/zle module

Old system: `compctl` replaced by [`compinit`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html).

## Initialisation

Shell initilization performs operations depending on the execution context,
these operations can be mainly separated on *login* and *interactive* property.
An short summary can be found at [pyenv
wiki](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Unix-shell-initialization).

Basically:

- *login*: e.g. when user logs in to a system with non-graphical interface or
  via SSH;
- *interactive*: shell that has a prompt and whose standard input and error are
  both connected to terminals.

If `$ZDOTDIR`, `$RCS` or `$GLOABL_RCS` are not set, Zsh performs initialiation
in the following order:

- `/etc/zsh/zshenv`
- `~/.zshenv`
- login mode:
	- `/etc/zsh/zprofile`
	- `~/.zprofile`
- interactive:
	- `/etc/zsh/zshrc`
	- `~/.zshrc`
- login mode:
	- `/etc/zsh/login`
	- `~/.zlogin`

`.zlogout` and `/etc/zsh/zshlogout` are called when exiting, not when opening.

See [this post](https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html)
for a complementary information.

## Readline capability: `ZLE`

Zsh does not use readline, instead uses an own development [Zsh Line Editor
(ZLE)](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html). Keybindings
in `inputrc` are not read, rely instead on an internal command
[`bindkey`](`terminfo`) that can be coupled to `terminfo`.

All actions in the editor are performed by
[widgets](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Zle-Widgets).

Bindings are affected to **keymaps**. The current used keymap is `main`.

Initially, there are eight keymaps:

- `emacs`  EMACS emulation
- `viins`  vi emulation - insert mode
- `vicmd`  vi emulation - command mode
- `viopp`  vi emulation - operator pending
- `visual` vi emulation - selection active
- `isearch` incremental search mode
- `command` read a command name
- `.safe`  fallback keymap

These keymaps can be accessed l

Keymap can be created and must be affected to `main` to be in use:
```bash
bindkey -N mymap viins
bindkey -A mymap main
```

New bindings are affected to the current (`main`) **keymap**.

- `bindkey -lL` shows  which  keymap is linked to `main'.
- `zle -la` list all existing keymap names in the form of bindkey commands to create or link the keymaps.

## Prompt

Prompt sequences undergo a [special form of
expansion](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html). Some
modules make it easier to personalize the prompt.

The prompt system must be loaded (performed by extensions): `autoload -U
promptinit; promptinit`.

A theme can be applied with the `prompt` cmd.

```bash
❯ prompt <TAB>
-- prompt theme --
adam1    bigfade  elite    fire     pure     restore  zefram
adam2    clint    elite2   off      pws      suse
bart     default  fade     oliver   redhat   walters
```

Third party modules:

- <b>spaceshift</b> <badge-stars repo='denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt'></badge-stars> is a pure zsh prompt providing VCS integration, language version, job indicator and more.
- <b>starshift</b> <badge-stars repo='starship/starship'></badge-stars> is a port of spaceshift in rust.
- <b>pure</b> <badge-stars repo='sindresorhus/pure'></badge-stars> is a lighweight prompt in pure zsh.

If you have sufficient privileges, you may change the effective user ID of the shell process by assigning to this parameter. Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you may start a single command with a different effective user ID by ‘(EUID=uid; command)’                                                                                                        |

This value is system dependent and is intended for debugging purposes. It is also useful with the zsh/system module which allows the number to be turned into a name or message.                                                                                                                                       |
    | `FUNCNEST` <S>                                    | Integer. If greater than or equal to zero, the maximum nesting depth of shell functions. When it is exceeded, an error is raised at the point where a function is called. The default value is determined when the shell is configured, but is typically 500. Increasing the value increases the danger of a runaway function recursion causing the shell to crash. Setting a negative value turns off the check. |
    | `GID` <S>                                         | The real group ID of the shell process. If you have sufficient privileges, you may change the group ID of the shell process by assigning to this parameter. Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you may start a single command under a different group ID by ‘(GID=gid; command)’                                                                                                                              |
    | `HISTCMD`                                         | The current history event number in an interactive shell, in other words the event number for the command that caused $HISTCMD to be read. If the current history event modifies the history, HISTCMD changes to the new maximum history event number.                                                                                                                                                            |
    | `HOST`                                            | The current hostname.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
    | `LINENO` <S>                                      | The line number of the current line within the current script, sourced file, or shell function being executed, whichever was started most recently. Note that in the case of shell functions the line number refers to the function as it appeared in the original definition, not necessarily as displayed by the functions builtin.                                                                             |
    | `LOGNAME`                                         | If the corresponding variable is not set in the environment of the shell, it is initialized to the login name corresponding to the current login session. This parameter is exported by default but this can be disabled using the typeset builtin. The value is set to the string returned by the man page getlogin(3) system call if that is available.                                                         |

    | `TRY_BLOCK_INTERRUPT` <S>                         | This variable works in a similar way to `TRY_BLOCK_ERROR`, but represents the status of an interrupt from the signal SIGINT, which typically comes from the keyboard when the user types ^C. If set to 0, any such interrupt will be reset; otherwise, the interrupt is propagated after the always block.                                                                                                        |

    | `UID <S>`                                         | The real user ID of the shell process.
    | `USERNAME` <S>                                    | The username corresponding to the real user ID of the shell process. If you have sufficient privileges, you may change the username (and also the user ID and group ID) of the shell by assigning to this parameter. Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you may start a single command under a different username (and user ID and group ID) by ‘(USERNAME=username; command)’                                |
    | `VENDOR`                                          | The vendor, as determined at compile time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

    | `ZSH_ARGZERO`                                     | If zsh was invoked to run a script, this is the name of the script. Otherwise, it is the name used to invoke the current shell. This is the same as the value of $0 when the POSIX_ARGZERO option is set, but is always available.                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Data structures

### Associative arrays

Declared with `declare -A <ARRAY>` or `typeset -A <ARRAY>`

!!! danger ""
    Associative arrays can not be nested


## Functions

[autoload](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Functions)

### [Hook functions](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Hook-Functions)

It is possible to define an array that has the same name as the function with
`_functions` appended. Any element in such an array is taken as the name of a
function to execute; it is executed in the same context and with the same
arguments as the basic function.

!!! example

    ```bash
    ❯ echo $precmd_functions
    _zsh_autosuggest_start _zsh_highlight_main__precmd_hook _zshz_precmd prompt_pure_precmd

    # Show the definition of a function:
    # it is possible to use `which` or nearly identical to bash `type -f`
    ❯ whence -f _zsh_autosuggest_start
    ```


- **chpwd**: executed whenever the current working directory is changed.

- **periodic**: if the parameter PERIOD is set, this function is executed every
$PERIOD seconds, just before a prompt.

- **precmd**: executed before each prompt.

- **preexec**: executed just after a command has been read and is about to be
executed.

- **zshaddhistory**: executed when a history line has been read interactively,
but before it is executed.

- **zshexit**: executed at the point where the main shell is about to exit
normally.

## Expansion

This section is a cheatsheet on expansion, based on the manual and reads,
especially this [blog
post](https://reasoniamhere.com/2014/01/11/outrageously-useful-tips-to-master-your-z-shell/).

The examples hereunder are taken from the latest and to be run, interactive
comments must be enabled in zsh (`setopt interactive_comments`).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/fesaille/a3ec9617ef2e6e22d86382c08d46dcb3.js"></script>


The following types of expansions are performed in the indicated order in five
steps:

- **History Expansion** is performed only in interactive shells.

- **Alias Expansion** Aliases are expanded immediately.

- **Process Substitution**, **Parameter Expansion**, **Command Substitution**,
**Arithmetic Expansion**, **Brace Expansion**

These five are performed in left-to-right fashion. On each argument, any of
the five steps that are needed are performed one after the other. Hence, for
example, all the parts of parameter expansion are completed before command
substitution is started. After these expansions, all unquoted occurrences of
the characters ‘\’,‘’’ and ‘"’ are removed.

- **Filename Expansion**

If the `SH_FILE_EXPANSION` option is set, the order of expansion is
modified for compatibility with sh and ksh: filename expansion
is performed immediately after alias expansion.

- **Filename Generation**, commonly referred to as globbing, always done last.


### Filename generation (globbing)

#### [glob operators](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Glob-Operators)

- `*` matches any string, including the null string.
- `?` matches any character.
- `[...]` matches any of the enclosed characters:
- ranges of characters can be specified by separating two characters by a `-` or classes as `[:alnum:]`, `[:alpha:]`, `[:ascii:]`, ..., `[:xdigit:]`
- `!` or `^` negates the class
- `<[x]-[y]>` matches any number in the range x to y, inclusive.
- `(...)` matches the enclosed pattern.
- `x|y` matches either x or y.
- `^x` matches anything except the pattern x. Requires `EXTENDED_GLOB` to be set.
- `x~y` match anything that matches the pattern x but does not match y. Requires `EXTENDED_GLOB` to be set.
- `x#` Matches zero or more occurrences of the pattern x. Requires `EXTENDED_GLOB` to be set.
- `x##` Matches one or more occurrences of the pattern x. Requires `EXTENDED_GLOB` to be set.


The precedence of the operators given above is (highest) ‘^’, ‘/’, ‘~’, ‘|’ (lowest)

  ```bash
  # list text files that end in a number from 1 to 10
  ❯ ls -l zsh_demo/**/*<1-10>.txt

  # list text files that start with the letter a
  ❯ ls -l zsh_demo/**/[a]*.txt

  # list text files that start with either ab or bc
  ❯ ls -l zsh_demo/**/(ab|bc)*.txt

  # list text files that don't start with a lower or uppercase c
  ❯ ls -l zsh_demo/**/[^cC]*.txt

  # Remove all but go.mod
  ❯ setopt extended_glob
  ❯ rm -Rf -- ^go.mod
  ```

#### [glob flag](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Glob-Flags)

- `i` case insensitive.
- `l` lower case characters in the pattern match upper or lower case characters. Upper case characters behvior unchanged.
- `I` case sensitive: locally negates the effect of i or l from that point on.
- ...


#### [glob qualifiers](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Glob-Qualifiers)

    | -               | toggles between making the qualifiers work on symbolic links (the default) and the files they point to                        |

  ```bash
  # show only directories

  ❯ vim zsh_demo/**/*(.)

  # show empty files
  ❯ ls -l zsh_demo/**/*(L0)

  # show files greater than 3 KB

## Completion

 <badge-doc
 href='http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html'></badge-doc>

### Initialization

```bash
# menu-select widget, part of the zsh/complist module
# must be loaded before the call to compinit
zmodload -i zsh/complist
# Use modern completion system
autoload -U compinit
compinit
```

### Cache reset

```bash
rm -f ~/.zcompdump% compinit 
```

#### Behind the hood

Completion is provided by files named as the command name prefixed by an
underscore: `_cmd` contains the completion logic for `cmd`. The location of this
file must be in `$fpath`. Addition of a path can be done with `fpath+=<PATH TO
COMPLETION FILE>`.

When `compinit` is run, the first line of accessible files in `$fpath` is read.
Those containing one of the tags [`#compdef` or
`#autoload`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html#Autoloaded-files)
will be autoloaded.
The declaration can be done for multiple commands, function aliases can be
referenced too, e.g. `slogin` to `ssh` hereunder:

```
#compdef ssh slogin=ssh scp ssh-add ssh-agent ssh-copy-id ssh-keygen ssh-keyscan sftp
```

As an alternative, `compdef` [may be called
directly](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html#Functions-4)
