# ZSH

## Startup

 There are five startup files that zsh will read commands from:

`$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv`
`$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
`$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
`$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
`$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout

 If ZDOTDIR is not set, then the value of HOME is used; this is the usual case. See http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html



## Completion

See https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/blob/master/zsh-completions-howto.org
